# The following rules are from Prettier
# https://github.com/prettier/plugin-ruby/blob/main/rubocop.yml

# Disabling all Layout/* rules, as they're unnecessary when the user is using
# Syntax Tree to handle all of the formatting.
Layout:
  Enabled: false

# Re-enable Layout/LineLength because certain cops that most projects use
# (e.g. Style/IfUnlessModifier) require Layout/LineLength to be enabled.
# By leaving it disabled, those rules will mis-fire.
#
# Users can always override these defaults in their own rubocop.yml files.
# https://github.com/prettier/plugin-ruby/issues/825
Layout/LineLength:
  Enabled: true
  Max: 100

Style/MultilineIfModifier:
  Enabled: false

# Syntax Tree will expand empty methods to put the end keyword on the subsequent
# line to reduce git diff noise.
Style/EmptyMethod:
  EnforcedStyle: expanded

# lambdas that are constructed with the lambda method call cannot be safely
# turned into lambda literals without removing a method call.
Style/Lambda:
  Enabled: false

# When method chains with multiple blocks are chained together, rubocop will let
# them pass if they're using braces but not if they're using do and end
# keywords. Because we will break individual blocks down to using keywords if
# they are multiline, this conflicts with rubocop.
Style/MultilineBlockChain:
  Enabled: false

Style/StringLiterals:
  EnforcedStyle: double_quotes

Style/StringLiteralsInInterpolation:
  Enabled: false

Style/QuotedSymbols:
  Enabled: false

# We let users have a little more freedom with symbol and words arrays. If the
# user only has an individual item like ["value"] then we don't bother
# converting it because it ends up being just noise.
Style/SymbolArray:
  Enabled: false

Style/WordArray:
  Enabled: false

# Disable the trailing-comma rules as these depend on whether the user has added
# or not `plugin/trailing_comma` for `syntax_tree`
